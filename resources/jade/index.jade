            h3.text-center Still about me
              small.text-uppercase But more technically (a.k.a Resume)

            p I started to code in my high-school youth. From then I'm learning new things and doing some cool shit.
            p My friends and I founded the very first dev community around Google products which later became an official Google Developers Group in Georgia - #[a(href="https://www.facebook.com/gdgtbilisi/", rel="nofollow", target="_blank") GDG Tbilisi].
            p After several years we founded #[a(href="https://www.facebook.com/unihackge/", rel="nofollow", target="_blank") uniHack] and organized hackathons for students. We became partners with #[a(href="https://mlh.io", rel="nofollow", target="_blank") MLH] and several other awesome organizations.
            p I'm also very proud to be a member of #[a(href="https://github.com/orgs/nodejs/people" rel="nofollow", target="_blank") Node.js Foundation] and a contributor of open-source world.
